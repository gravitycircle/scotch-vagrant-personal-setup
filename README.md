# Personal Scotch Box Server:

Currently, still vanilla, however I will be customising this as I go.

For more information, visit [Scotch Box](http://box.scotch.io) for more information.

### More Information
Currently, I only have phpmyadmin installed at the tools folder. I will add into this as I go developing sites on this server. I still have a long way to go as I only started using Vagrant for the past few days. If you have any advice about Vagrant, [send me an email](mailto:richard.y.ong@outlook.com) or a message here on github.

Thanks!
